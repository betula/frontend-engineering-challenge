For simplify code of assignment test (because it's not used for production, and serveing for a demonstration of my quick implementation skills):

- I used "px" as unit for everything. For production we will discuss about using "rem" for correct interfce scaling.
- I did not use css variables or more complex preprocessos like SCSS
- I did not make universal UI kit for components that possible reusable in future development in project groth.
- I did not use any existings UI kit libraries for demonstrate my clear coding skills.
- I did not use any UI preloader indicators, according to simplify code, and not exists them in Figma design
