Assignment test

### Client (vite)

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

For building chrome extension you should

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and "Load unpacked" extension from "client/dist" folder.

### Server (nest)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

# Remark

To simplify the code of the assignment test (because it's not used for production, and serves as a demonstration of my quick implementation skills):

- I used "px" as a unit for everything.
- I did not use css variables or more complex preprocessors like SCSS
- I did not make a universal UI kit for components that could be reusable in future development in project growth.
- I used no existing UI kit libraries to demonstrate my clear coding skills.
- I did not use UI preloader indicators, according to simplify code, and they are not exists them in Figma design
- I did not implement accessibility
- I did not cover the code with unit tests due to the short implementation time.
- I didn't add support for arrow navigation on search autosuggestions, but implemented tab navigation throughout the project.
- Pure markup verified on Chrome, Safari and Firefox

I've already covered Figma's design errors regarding the "Spice level", "Produce" fields, as well as icons, recipe cooking times, and other inconsistencies between API responses and design in Figma. I'm sure you know about all this and probably you tested my ability to make decisions and not slow down the development process with lengthy discussions.

## With best wishes for further cooperation.

I will count on my coding skills to suit your project and be a great addition to your team!

Thanks,
